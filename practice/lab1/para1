The sun had already set, casting a soft glow over the horizon. 
The quiet street was illuminated by the streetlights, their yellow light reflecting off the wet pavement. 
People walked briskly, their breath visible in the cool evening air. Cars passed by, their headlights cutting through the darkness. 
Everything seemed calm, yet there was a sense of anticipation in the atmosphere.
